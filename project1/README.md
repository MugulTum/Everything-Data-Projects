### World Happiness Report 2024 EDA Analysis
The World Happiness Report is an important report that sheds light on the social wellbeing of people across the globe. 
Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the World Happiness Report dataset, we can uncover insights and patterns related to global happiness and this can help us understand the factors that influence happiness across the world. 

### Data cleaning 
In data cleaning, I removed rows with missing values and also renamed the columns in the dataset to make them easily understandable. Thereafter, I make various plots to understand the distribution of the data and also how various variables are related. 

#### Summary of Findings

Our analysis of global happiness data has highlighted several key factors and regional trends:

1. **Key Determinants of Happiness**: The factors with the most significant impact on happiness are GDP per capita, social support, freedom to make life choices, and health life expectancy. These variables collectively contribute to a more positive sense of well-being and life satisfaction.

2. **Regional Happiness Trends**: The happiness levels across different regions exhibit notable patterns:
   - **High Happiness**: Scandinavian countries, along with other Western European nations, are among the happiest. They are followed by countries in North America, Australia, and New Zealand.
   - **Moderate Happiness**: South American countries, Russia, and East Asian nations display relatively higher levels of happiness compared to other regions.
   - **Lower Happiness**: Countries in Africa, the Middle East, and India generally report lower levels of happiness.

#### Insights

1. **Economic and Social Well-being**: The significant influence of GDP per capita, social support, and health life expectancy underscores the importance of economic stability and robust social systems in fostering happiness. These factors suggest that countries investing in economic growth and social infrastructure may see improved overall well-being among their populations.

2. **Freedom and Personal Choice**: The role of freedom to make life choices indicates that personal autonomy and the ability to shape one's own life are crucial for happiness. Societies that promote individual rights and opportunities for personal decision-making are likely to enhance their citizens' sense of satisfaction.

3. **Regional Disparities**: The observed regional disparities in happiness reflect a complex interplay of economic development, social policies, and cultural factors. Higher happiness in certain regions may be attributed to a combination of advanced social services, higher incomes, and supportive social environments. Conversely, lower happiness in other regions could be related to challenges such as economic hardship, political instability, and limited access to social resources.

#### Implications for Global Happiness

1. **Policy Focus**: To improve global happiness, policymakers should prioritize enhancing economic conditions, expanding social support systems, and ensuring access to quality healthcare. Additionally, promoting personal freedoms and ensuring that individuals have the autonomy to make life choices are critical for fostering a more satisfied and content populace.

2. **Global Cooperation and Development**: Addressing the happiness disparity across regions requires international cooperation and targeted development initiatives. Efforts to alleviate poverty, improve healthcare infrastructure, and support social services in less happy regions could help reduce global inequality in happiness.

3. **Cultural and Regional Sensitivities**: While general strategies can be formulated, it's important to consider cultural and regional differences when implementing happiness-enhancing policies. Tailoring approaches to local contexts and needs can make interventions more effective and sustainable.

In summary, improving global happiness involves a multi-faceted approach that addresses economic, social, and personal factors. By focusing on these areas and considering regional variations, there is potential to enhance well-being on a global scale.
